# Hive Demo

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Setup

I used node version 14, so use that when you run the demo.

### `nvm install 14`
### `nvm use 14`

Clone the repository into the directory of your choosing. Then run:

### `npm install` (sass is the only dependency besides react, scss is very nice to have)

run the app with

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

Have fun! 

I left a few notes in the code such as a flag to test with an absurdly large list.
